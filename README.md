# DROP THE BEAT

## Problems faced:

- Automate the creation of every instances from one input Object
- Automate the creation and the assignation of every audio elements for each instance
- Drag & Drop elements: solution = [DOM - Drag & drop events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document#Drag_drop_events)
- HTML5 audio loops have a break between each loop: solution = [creation of a buffer function](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36720740)
- Sounds' synch playback: solution = all the audio files have the same lenght/tempo + with some calculation, each time we drop a new element, the playback starts from the currentTime of the previous element.
